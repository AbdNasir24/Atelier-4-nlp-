Final Report :
Comprehensive NLP Project Using PyTorch

Objective

The main goal of this lab was to gain hands-on experience with various NLP models using the PyTorch library. This comprehensive project was divided into three parts:

Classification Regression with RNNs
Text Generation with Transformers (GPT-2)
Text Classification with BERT
Each part aimed to introduce different aspects and techniques in natural language processing, from basic RNNs to advanced transformer-based models.

Part 1: Classification Regression
Overview
In this part, we focused on collecting Arabic text data, preprocessing it, and building regression models using RNN architectures to predict relevance scores.

Key Steps and Findings
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Arabic text data was scraped from various websites and assigned relevance scores between 0 and 10.
Text data was tokenized, and a vocabulary was built for encoding.
Model Training:

An RNN model was trained over 10 epochs.
Training loss decreased significantly, indicating effective learning.
Model Evaluation:

Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
Results: High MSE and negative R² score suggested overfitting or noisy data.
Conclusion
While the RNN model showed good learning during training, its generalization to validation data was poor, highlighting the need for better data quality and potential model enhancements.

Part 2: Transformer (Text Generation)
Overview
This part involved fine-tuning a pre-trained GPT-2 model for text generation based on a given prompt.

Key Steps and Findings
Model Fine-Tuning:

The GPT-2 model was fine-tuned on a custom dataset.
Training loss decreased over epochs, indicating successful adaptation.
Text Generation:

The model generated text based on a starting sentence.
Example generated text showed coherence and relevance to the prompt.
Conclusion
The fine-tuned GPT-2 model demonstrated strong capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant text. The results validated the effectiveness of transformer-based models in text generation tasks.

Part 3: BERT (Text Classification)
Overview
In the final part, we fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model for text classification tasks using the Amazon product reviews dataset.

Key Steps and Findings
Data Preparation:

Text data was tokenized and encoded using the BERT tokenizer.
The dataset was divided into training and validation sets.
Model Fine-Tuning:

The BERT model was fine-tuned with appropriate hyperparameters.
Training metrics improved over epochs, indicating effective learning.
Model Evaluation:

Metrics: Accuracy, Loss, F1 Score, BLEU Score, and BERT Score.
Results: High accuracy and balanced F1 score demonstrated the model's effectiveness.
Conclusion
The fine-tuned BERT model performed well on the text classification task, showcasing its robustness and ability to generalize to new data.

General Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive exploration of various NLP techniques and models:

Traditional RNN Models:

Highlighted the challenges in training and generalizing with simpler architectures.
